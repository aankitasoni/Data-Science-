# What is Data Science?

Data science is the study of data. It is the process of using data to understand different things, to understand the world. 

Data science is a field about processes and systems to extract data from various forms of whether it is unstructured or structured form. But what is Data Science? I'd see data science as one's attempt to work with data, to find answers to questions that they are exploring. In a nutshell, it's more about data than it is about science. If you have data, and you have curiosity, and you're working with data, and you're manipulating it, you're exploring it, the very exercise of going through analyzing data, trying to get some answers from it is data science.

Data science can help organizations understand their environments, analyze existing issues, and reveal previously hidden opportunities. Data scientists use data analysis to add to the knowledge of the organization by investigating data, exploring the best way to use it to provide value to the business. 

Data scientists can analyze structured and unstructured data from many sources, and depending on the nature of the problem, they can choose to analyze the data in different ways. Using multiple models to explore the data reveals patterns and outliers; sometimes, this will confirm what the organization suspects, but sometimes it will be completely new knowledge, leading the organization to a new approach.



# Advice to the New Data Scientists.

An aspiring data scientist is to be curious, extremely argumentative and judgmental. 

  - Curiosity is absolute must. If you're not curious, you would not know what to do with the data. 
  - Judgmental because if you do not have preconceived notions about things you wouldn't know where to begin with. 
  - Argumentative because if you can argument and if you can plead a case, at least you can start somewhere and then you learn from data and then you modify your assumptions and hypotheses and your data would help you learn.



# Role of Cloud for Data Science.

* Cloud is a godsend for data scientists. It allows us to bypass the physical limitations of the computers and the systems we're using and allows us to deploy the analytics and storage capacities of advanced machines that do not necessarily have to be our machine or our company's machine. 

* Cloud have the algorithms available, so we deploy those algorithms on very large datasets and we're able to do it even though our own systems, our own machines, our own computing environments were not allowing us to do so.

* Using the Cloud enables us to get instant access to open source technologies like Apache Spark without the need to install and configure them locally. Using the Cloud also gives you access to the most up-to-date tools and libraries without the worry of maintaining them and ensuring that they are up to date. 

* The Cloud is accessible from everywhere and in every time zone.



# Foundations of Big Data.

### **What is Big Data?**
 “Big Data refers to the dynamic, large and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools, and machines. It requires new, innovative, and scalable technology to collect, host, and analytically process the vast amount of data gathered in order to derive real-time business insights that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management, and enhanced shareholder value.” - Ernst and Young
 
 #### There are V's of Big Data:
 * **Velocity** - Velocity is the speed at which data accumulates. Data is being generated extremely fast, in a process that never stops. Near or real-time streaming, local, and cloud-based technologies can process information very quickly.

 * **Volume** - Volume is the scale of the data, or the increase in the amount of data stored. Drivers of volume are the increase in data sources, higher resolution sensors, and scalable infrastructure.
 
 * **Variety** - Variety is the diversity of the data. Structured data fits neatly into rows and columns, in relational databases while unstructured data is not organized in a pre-defined way, like Tweets, blog posts, pictures, numbers, and video. 
 
    Variety also reflects that data comes from different sources, machines, people, and processes, both internal and external to organizations. Drivers are mobile technologies, social media, wearable technologies, geo technologies, video, and many, many more. 
 
 * **Veracity** - Veracity is the quality and origin of data, and its conformity to facts and accuracy. 
     - Attributes include consistency, completeness, integrity, and ambiguity. 
     - Drivers include cost and the need for traceability. 
 
    With the large amount of data available, the debate rages on about the accuracy of data in the digital age. Is the information real, or is it false?
    
    80% of data is considered to be unstructured and we must devise ways to produce reliable and accurate insights. The data must be categorized, analyzed, and visualized. 
 
 * **Value** - Value is our ability and need to turn data into value. Value isn't just profit. It may have medical or social benefits, as well as customer, employee, or personal satisfaction. The main reason that people invest time to understand Big Data is to derive value from it.


So the scale of the data being collected means that it’s not feasible to use conventional data analysis tools. However, alternative tools that leverage distributed computing power can overcome this problem. Tools such as **Apache Spark** (Open source unified analytics engine for large scale data processing), **Hadoop** (Open source framework that is used to efficiently store and process large datasets ranging in size from gigabytes to petabytes of data) and its ecosystem provide ways to extract, load, analyze, and process the data across distributed compute resources, providing new insights and knowledge. 

This gives organizations more ways to connect with their customers and enrich the services they offer.
