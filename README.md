# What is Data Science?

Data science is the study of data. It is the process of using data to understand different things, to understand the world. 

Data science is a field about processes and systems to extract data from various forms of whether it is unstructured or structured form. But what is Data Science? I'd see data science as one's attempt to work with data, to find answers to questions that they are exploring. In a nutshell, it's more about data than it is about science. If you have data, and you have curiosity, and you're working with data, and you're manipulating it, you're exploring it, the very exercise of going through analyzing data, trying to get some answers from it is data science.

Data science can help organizations understand their environments, analyze existing issues, and reveal previously hidden opportunities. Data scientists use data analysis to add to the knowledge of the organization by investigating data, exploring the best way to use it to provide value to the business. 

Data scientists can analyze structured and unstructured data from many sources, and depending on the nature of the problem, they can choose to analyze the data in different ways. Using multiple models to explore the data reveals patterns and outliers; sometimes, this will confirm what the organization suspects, but sometimes it will be completely new knowledge, leading the organization to a new approach.


# Advice to the New Data Scientists.

An aspiring data scientist is to be curious, extremely argumentative and judgmental. 

* Curiosity is absolute must. If you're not curious, you would not know what to do with the data. 
* Judgmental because if you do not have preconceived notions about things you wouldn't know where to begin with. 
* Argumentative because if you can argument and if you can plead a case, at least you can start somewhere and then you learn from data and then you modify your assumptions and hypotheses and your data would help you learn.
